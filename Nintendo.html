<h2>The Beginning Of Nintendo</h2>
   
   
 
































    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nintendo, founded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusajiro_Yamauchi"><em>Fusajiro Yamauchi</em></a>, was created in 1889. Yamauchi started
    producing Hanafuda, Japanese playing cards, in 1959. The name was switch to Nintendo
    playing cards <br>with <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Disney-Company"><em>Disney</em></a> as a partner. In 1963, the name was factored down to just
    Nintendo. The following years, playing cards became less popular, which in 1964                  
    the company's stocks started to fall. Nintendo started to invest in all
    sorts of businesses which focus on the toy business. Nintendo invented
    the first ever electronic toy in the Japanese market, the <a href="beamgun.html"><em>beam gun</em></a>, in 1970. This
    also contributed to the <a href="NESZapper.html"><em>NES Zapper</em></a> which was an aspect to
    <a href="DuckHunt.html"><em>Duck Hunt</em></a> and <a href="WildGunman.html"><em>Wild Gunman</em></a>. An American company that went by Magnavox made the first ever
    commerically owned video game console called the <em>Magnavox Odssey</em> in 1972, which Nintendo got the rights to sell
    the console in Japan the following years. Nintendo saw the massive success the console brought <br>and
    decided to create their own type of consoles.

<br><h2>Nintendo's Electronic Hardware</h2>
<br><h3>Nintendo's Early Consoles</h3>
   
   
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'Color TV-Game 6' was Nintendo's first commerically made console that came out in 1977 with Mitsubishi as a contributor.
    The six in the name represents how many games that the 'Color Tv-Game 6' could hold up to. A few years later a similar console came out with fifthteen games.
    What also came along were the 'TV-Game Racing 112, TV-Computer TV Game, and TV-Game Block Kuzushi'.

<br><h4>NES</h4>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) came out in 1985 and was very similar to
        the Japanese verison. The Japanese verison was called the Famicom and it was released in 1983 for <br>the Japanese market.
        The resolution for the console is 240p which makes good immerse 2D gameplay at the time and having 2 kb of ram.
        The NES helped save the 1983 video game industry crash because of its sleek design and multiplayer action.
        It set the longest manufacturer production in history with the Japanese version in production until 2003 and the US market  
        until 1995. The console came to sell at an astonishing 62 million units. At the time, Joy-sticks were the most commonly used controller of consoles, but Nintendo decided to add a D-pad to its own controller.
        The NES included popluar and upcoming franchises like Duck Hunt (1984), Super Mario Bros.(1985), Metroid(1986), Castlevania(1986),
        Legend of Zelda(1986), Final Fantasy (1987), and popular arcade games. Soon the Sega Genesis was announced which <br>Nintendo's next
        console was adding a <strong>S</strong> to the NES.
    </p>








<br><h4>SNES</h4>




<img class="img_deg2" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/SNES-Mod1-Console-Set.jpg" alt="SNES" width="230" height="200">




    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Super Nintendo Enteraiment System (SNES) came out in 1991 for the US Market and
        in the Japanese Market, the <strong>S</strong>(Super) was added to the Famicom in 1990. The Processing was <br>increased to a
        16-bit chip which included better cartridges and audio. The SNES is 64 times more powerful than its predecesor. During the
        time, Nintendo and Sega were in a bit-war to see <br>who was the superior company. Which Nintendo came out on top, selling
        49 million units. The controller was madeover in a more sleeker design. Addition buttons were added to the
        shoulders and front controller, which made this controller a signifcant factor to all upcoming console controllors.
        The SNES included titles like Super Mario World(1990), The Legend of Zelda:<em>A Link to the Past</em>(1991), Super Mario Kart(1992)
        , Donkey Kong Country(1994), Final Fintasy Six(1994), and Super Metroid(1994). The SNES was the pinnacle of 2D games, but the
        Playstation, Sony's newly develope console, was runing 3D games.
    </p>








<br><h4>N64</h4>




<img class="img_deg2" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/N64-Console-Set.jpg/1200px-N64-Console-Set.jpg" alt="N64"  width="230" height="200">
   
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nintendo 64 came out in 1996 and got the name from its 64-bit chip. At the time, the
        N64 was the most powerful console that ever came out. The N64 was 30 times more powerful than the SNES. The
        controller was very important in upcoming controllors by adding the <br>first ever analog stick.
        The console sold 33 million units, but Nintendo's major competitor, Sony, had sold an astonishing
        102 million units off their first Playstation. Nintendo's consoles came to be known as family base entertainment instead
        of serious gaming. Nintendo took advantage with the newly develop 3D graphics with releasing big titles like Super Mario 64(1996),
        Mario Kart 64(1996), GoldenEye 007(1997), The Legend of Zelda:<em>Ocarina of Time</em>(1998), Pokemon Stadium(1998), Super Smash Bros.(1999),
        and Donkey Kong 64(1999).
    </p>




<br><h4>GameCube</h4>




<img class="img_deg2" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61cc-278k0L.jpg" alt="Gamecube" width="230" height="200">
   
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GameCube came out in 2001 and Nintendo made sure it competed with the <em> Playstation two</em>
        and Microsoft's first ever console, the xbox. The GameCube was 5 times more powerful than its predessor and made gaming
        more immerse into the 3D world. The resolution for the GameCube is 480p which made gaming more sharp. Nintendo decided to use
        mini-discs instead of cartridges for the first time. The GameCube sold 22 million units which was less than any other Nintendo
        console at the time. One reason why the console got a decrease in sales was the absence of online gaming which there was only a few games with internet at the time.
        It utilized memory cards because there was no internal hard drive on this console. Playstation sold an astonishing 160
        million units, which overcame every Nintendo console that came out thus far and brutally destroyed the GameCube. The console featured titles like
        Super Mario Sunshine (2001), Animal Crossing(2001), Luigi's Mansion(2001), and Metroid Prime(2002).
    </p>




<br><h4>Wii</h4>




<img class="img_deg2" src="https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/30649fe0-716b-4ad2-b60e-d3e918276082.b3ce5dd4fda1ad6c5542ec389708976f.jpeg?odnHeight=768&odnWidth=768&odnBg=FFFFFF" alt="Wii" width="230" height="200">
   
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wii came out in 2006 and Nintendo decided to really focus on the fun factor of <br>gaming in this
        console instead of competing with its two competitors to see who had the most powerful console. The Wii stands for "we" which  
        Nintendo really focused on this factor for everyone instead of hardcore gamers. It was more widely targeted to a bigger audience
        then its predecessors and rivals. The resolution for the Wii is 480p and its memory is 64 MB. The Wii is 1.2 times more powerful
        than its predessor which wasn't a massive power upgrade compared to Sony and Mircosoft during the time. The Wii remote was the main
        controller that featured motion control for the first time in the gaming world. The controller came with a D-pad, buttons, bluetooth, and
        an interalspeaker. The Nunchuk was a secondary controller for the Wii that featured two trigger buttons and an analog stick. The Wii
        top Sony's Playstation three and Mircosoft's xbox 360 with an astonishing 102 million units sold which beat every console that Nintendo
        made thus far. Nintendo had an idea to bundle a free game with the console called Wii Sports. The game came out in 2006
        which included five different sports with your very own customizable characters(Miis) in the game. The most important thing about this
        game was the player base. Which means any casual player loved this game because of its organic gaming experience. The Wii included titles
        such as Legend of Zelda:<em>Twilight Princess</em>(2006), Super Mario Galaxy(2007), and Mario Kart Wii(2008).
    </p>








<br><h4>Wii U</h4>




<img class="img_deg2" src="https://agrlv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wiiu-ss-blk.jpg" alt="Wii U" width="230" height="200">




    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wii U came out in 2012 and was a massive flop due to bad marketing and confusion. Nintendo decided that
        they were hooked with the casual gamers into their consoles, but what about trational gamers. That's why the power upgrade massively gain more than
        it's perivous predeccor, topping out at 20 times more powerful than the previos generation. The Wii U runs 60 frames per second with a resolution of
        720p. The gamepad has a touch screen and most game time could be play on it as a handheld, it works as a dual screen with two screens on
        the same game. The Wii remote from the previous predeccor could still be connected to be used for the Wii U. Just like with the wii, Nintendo added another
        free game with the console called Nintendo Land. It had countless more mini games than Wii Sports that included your very own customizable characters(Miis)
        in the game too. The Wii U came in a simple white color verison and also offering an exclusive black verison too, but the drawback was the amount of sales
        on the console. The Wii U only sold 13 million units, making it only a fracture of its previous predeccor and given the title of least amount of home consoles
        sold in Nintendo's history of homeintertainment. Casual players thought it was an accessory for the Wii through thier advertisement. The Wii U included
        titles such as New Super Mario Bros. U(2012), Super Mario 3D World(2013), Mario Kart 8(2014), Splatoon(2015), and Super Mario Maker(2015). The gamepad was
        like a predecessor to the Nintendo Switch because it acts as a handheld gaming experience.




       




<br><br><h4>Nintendo Switch</h4>




<img class="img_deg2" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Nintendo-Switch-Console-Docked-wJoyConRB.jpg/2560px-Nintendo-Switch-Console-Docked-wJoyConRB.jpg" alt="Wii" width="230" height="200">
   
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nintendo Switch came out in 2017 and it was Nintendo's biggest success in home entertainment. The Nintendo Switch
        doesn't have a massive power upgrade over its perivous predeccor, only topping out at 1.5 times more powerful than the Wii U, but it functions as a
        handheld console. Having all the power in the handheld makes it where you can resume your gaming experience anywhere and at any time. Its less compact
        then its predeccors with all of it being in your hand. The newly develop Joy Cons can be able to detach from the main screen to have multiplayer gaming
        experiences. The Joy Cons include gyro sensors for motion <br>control instead of putting a sensor block on your TV with the Wii and Wii U. The problem with the
        Joy Cons is when its over use, it creates Joystick drift. The Nintendo Switch already sold more than any other Console that came out by nintendo, making an
        absurd 111 million units sold thus far. The Nintendo Switch included poplular titles like Splatoon 2(2017), The Legend of Zelda:<em>Breath of the Wild</em>(2017),
        Super Mario Odyssey(2017), Mario Kart 8 Deluxe(2017),<br> Super Smash Bros. Ultimate(2018), and Animal Crossing:<em>New Horizens</em>(2020).
